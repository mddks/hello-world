<title>Mission 1: Information</title>
<h3>The Mission:</h3>
<p>The first mission assigned to me is to go undercover as a high school student and recover as much information as possible 
concerning the Middlesex School. The school, although not trying to hide behind a public school front, is indeed hiding a lot. 
I was not told much about the school or community -- I will seem like a normal, somewhat clueless freshman excited to start her
first year at MX.</p>
<p>I will report any important or potentially dangerous information as they are found.</p>
